					<h2>Quick Documentation</h2>
					<p>HDTasks was designed to be as easy and intuitive to use as possible. However, I understand that some guidance might still be needed.</p>
					<p>This system works off of <strong>Tasks</strong> and <strong>Projects</strong>, where all Tasks belong to a Project. So to get started, all you have to do is create a new Project. This can be done by selecting <strong>HDTasks</strong> from the left sidebar.</p>
					<p>Once a Project has been created, you will be able to set any individual project settings (eventually, settings such as if you want to allow file uploads, logins, etc), and you will also get a unique and secret URL for the project that you can share with your team or clients.</p>
					<p>All Projects and Tasks are blocked from being indexed, so the only way someone will find your project page is if you provide them with the secret link.</p>
					<h3>
						Add "tags" to Tasks
					</h3>
					<p>You can add as many tags to a task title as you want by prepending the tags to the start of a task title. Tags are made by encapsulating the tag beteen <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>.</p>
					<p>This can be useful for assigning a task to a specific team memeber, or categorizing your tasks.</p>
					<p>Exmaple task title with two tags: <code>[Dylan] [Important] Complete wireframe mockups and send</code>.</p>
					<p>The above example takes the title "Complete wireframe mockups and send" and creates two tags; Dylan, Important.</p>
					<h3>
						Generate Custom Member URLs
					</h3>
					<p>
						By default, HDTasks does not require any login or password to access; all that's needed is the secret URL. However, the downside to not having logins is that there is no way for HDTasks to know who you are (*without angering GDPR compliancy) until you enter your name. And even then, the name would only be stored in your browser for that single session.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because of this, I created a simple mechanism that will allow you to create a custom URL for each team member that already has their name embedded. This works by appending <code>?user=NAME</code> to the end of the project URL. So for example, let's assume your Project URL is <code>https://yourdomain.com/client-project/GoLeafs</code>. You could change it to any of the following examples:
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>https://yourdomain.com/client-project/GoLeafs?user=Dylan</code><br/>
						<code>https://yourdomain.com/client-project/GoLeafs?user=Jessica</code><br/>
						<code>https://yourdomain.com/client-project/GoLeafs?user=Prit</code><br/>
						<code>https://yourdomain.com/client-project/GoLeafs?user=Alex</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						and send those links to each of the people you want to give access to.
